        <h1>Supporting Mental Health on your PhD Journey</h1>
        <p>We connect current PhD students with PhD graduates who have walked a similar path.</p>
        <p>Through listening and sharing, we aim to give you a platform that makes your PhD journey less isolating and more empowering.</p>
        <p>We aspire to provide unbiased companionship because we share similar experiences with you.</p>
        <p>We want to hold empathetic space for you as you navigate challenges during your PhD – regardless of your academic course.</p>
        <p class="final-line"><em><strong>We believe that shared experience is a powerful form of support and healing.</strong></em></p>

          <h3>As a Graduate Buddy</h3>
          <p>Gain a connection with people who truly understand and can relate to you.</p>
          <p>Learn from the firsthand experience of someone who has already completed their PhD and explored life after it.</p>
          <p><strong>You might find PhD<em>buddy</em> helpful if any of the following resonate with you—just to name a few examples:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Are you feeling overwhelmed and unsure about how to talk to your supervisor?</li>
              <li>Are you questioning whether continuing your PhD still makes sense for you and what your next steps might be?</li>
              <li>Do you feel like an outsider in your academic environment and struggle to connect with colleagues?</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

          <img src="postBuddy.png" class="buddy-icon" alt="Post-graduate buddy icon">
          <h3>As a Post-Graduate Buddy</h3>
          <p>Have you ever wished you could go back to your first-year PhD self and share your hard-earned advice with them? While going back in time is not an option (yet), this is your chance to make a meaningful impact on someone else’s PhD journey.</p>
          <p>Gain a new perspective on your own experiences — you might find that all the highs and lows of your journey can become valuable lessons to share.</p>
          <p>Build new connections and help create a kinder, healthier research culture.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="final-line"><strong><em>PhD<em>buddy</em></em></strong> is about community, empathy, and making the PhD experience kinder for everyone.</p>

      <h3>How It Works</h3>
      <p>We match PhD students with post-graduates from our team.</p>
      <p>After you sign up, three post-graduate buddies are made available for you to connect with – you can get to know all of them and have conversations with whoever you choose or is available.</p>
      <p>We define the structure of the conversation together based on your needs and goals.</p>
      <p>We have open conversations with you about the non-academic, social, organizational, and mental challenges of your PhD journey.</p>
      <p>The conversations can happen as often as the graduate and post-graduate buddies agree on.</p>
      <p>We are not medical professionals; therefore, we are in no position to provide solutions about your personal journeys, but we are open to listening, sharing our experiences, and offering new perspectives.</p>
      <p>These conversations will be confidential.</p>
